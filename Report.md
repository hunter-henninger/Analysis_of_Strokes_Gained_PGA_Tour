# Analysis of Strokes Gained and Club Head Speed on the PGA Tour
_Author: Hunter Henninger_

## Introduction:

In the unpredictable game of golf, Strokes Gained has become the most accurate and meaningful way to measure player efficiency and performance since it began being tracked 2004. The Strokes Gained statistic is broken up into four parts: Off the Tee, Approach the Green, Around the Green and Putting. The sum of all four categories gives a players Total Strokes Gained for a given golf tournament. It essentially compares each stroke a player takes to the rest of the Tour based on distance remaining to the hole. &quot;Strokes Gained recognizes that sinking a 20-foot putt represents a better performance than sinking a three-foot putt, even though they both count as a single stroke on the scorecard&quot; (Mark Broadie, developer of Strokes Gained). Additionally, Club Head Speed, another relatively new statistic, began being recorded in 2007 using certain radar technology. Club Head Speed measures the speed at which the club impacts the ball in miles per hour only on Par 4 and Par 5 tee shots where a radar measurement was taken.

Many young golfers with swing speeds well above the Tour average (roughly 113-114mph) are experiencing major success on the PGA Tour in recent years. This study aims to capture statistical evidence of the impact of Club Head Speed on Total Strokes Gained. Through a process of wrangling, cleaning, manipulating, and modeling an extensive dataset of PGA metrics, this analysis numerically illustrates the disadvantage of having a slower Club Head Speed.

## Gathering Data:

The ShotLink System is the platform for multiple professional golf tours for collecting and disseminating scoring and statistical data for every shot by every player in real-time. The data used in this experiment is collected from the ShotLink database for 50 of the best players on the PGA Tour. For each player, it is broken up into the four Strokes Gained categories: Off the Tee, Approach the Green, Around the Green, and Putting. Initially, the goal was to use data for the top 50 players as of the end of 2018. Due to missing data, there is a list of top players that were not included. This includes some big golfer names such as Justin Rose, Ian Poulter, Adam Scott, Francesco Molinari, Sergio Garcia, and more. However, every golfer used is ranked in the top 100 in the world.

Once the four categories were merged and each players&#39; data was combined, the resulting dataset contained over 6,000 observations and over 90 different features. Each observation is a professional golf tournament for a single player and each feature is a measured statistic for that tournament. Because of the scope of this study, any observation that was missing a value in any Strokes Gained or Club Head Speed column was removed. Additionally, any observation where the player was cut, disqualified, or withdrew from the tournament was removed to make each observation comparable. The list of features contained a handful of metrics that take into account a golfers specific rank in a certain aspect of golf. These features were dropped from the dataframe as this analysis focuses on only raw golf statistics that a golfer at any skill level can compare themselves to. After the cleaning process, the dimensions of the dataframe resulted in 4,648 observations and 83 features (including Total Strokes Gained).

Even at this point, the dataset contained a large amount of missing values. This was the biggest roadblock of the entire study. The reason for missing data in the ShotLink data stems from the unpredictability of golf. ShotLink measures many aspects of every stroke taken in a golf tournament including the remaining distance to the hole from various distances away (approach shots, putts, etc.). So, for instance, if a player never finds themself approaching the hole from between 200 and 225 yards in the rough, ShotLink will leave that statistic empty for that golf tournament. This type of missingness is defined as NMAR (not missing at random). That is, the data is not missing because it was not tracked, it is missing because that scenario never occurred. NMAR null values are difficult to handle so it was approached with three different methods: ignore, hot-deck imputation, and regression imputation.

For the first method, columns and rows with extensive missing data were simply dropped and a smaller dataset (3,616 observations and 60 features) was saved.

The second method involved dropping columns with more than 500 missing values and imputing the remaining missing values with hot-deck imputation. This means that every missing value was replaced with a randomly selected value from the list of observed values for that specific metric for that specific player. This process sustains the original 4,648 observations and is left with 69 features.

The third method incorporates a few strategies. First, columns and rows with extensive missing data are dropped. For any column still containing null values, a new column is created with a 1 if that value is missing and a 0 if it is not. This step adds 22 new columns. These encoded columns will account for missingness in the regression models. The remaining missing values are then filled using regression imputation. That is, a predicted value is calculated with a linear regression that uses the observed values for that observation as predictors. Method 3 results in a dataframe with 4,538 golf tournaments and 91 statistics.

Handling the missing data results in three fairly different dataframes. The effectiveness of each method is compared in the modeling stage of this study. Approaching the missing data from three different angles ensures quality of the results.

## EDA:

Analyzed correlations and distributions to determine strong relationships. Visualized Strokes Gained average among players to explore player success and outliers.

## Modeling:

The main goal of the modeling process is to explain Total Strokes Gained using the many golf statistics in the data. This means that the target or dependent variable used in the models is Total Strokes Gained and the predictors or independent variables are each of the metrics. For all three methods of handling missing data, a baseline linear regression model is fit to the data. By comparing cross-validated R-squared scores on the training data with the unseen testing data, method one proves to explain the most variability in Strokes Gained. This implies that filling in the missing values with &quot;fake&quot; data only makes the predictability of golf performance more confusing. Because of this result, the dataframe created by ignoring the missing data is carried into the next step for model tuning.

Tuning the model requires fitting the data to multiple types of regressors. For the sake of interpretability, the models used are: simple linear regression, ridge regression, LASSO, random forest regressor, and extra-trees regressor.  Because of its regularization and feature selection, the LASSO explained the greatest amount of variability in Total Strokes Gained by accounting for 60.32%. By extracting the coefficients of the LASSO model and ranking them by magnitude, the regression offers insight into which metrics affect golf efficiency the most. The model suggests that Percentage of GIR and Scrambling Percentage have the strongest positive effects on Total Strokes Gained for a given golf tournament. Because the data was scaled before fitting the model, GIR Percentage with a coefficient of 0.647 implies that for every increases of 7.53% (one standard deviation) of GIR Percentage, that players&#39; Total Strokes Gained increases by 0.647 strokes. A group of putting metrics such as Putting Average and One Putt Percentage have the strongest negative influence on Total Strokes Gained.

To further the analysis towards Club Head Speed, the data is split into two based on the average Club Head Speed of the data (115.51mph). This creates a dataframe of golf tournaments where the players&#39; average Club Head Speed was below 115.51mph and another dataframe of tournaments where the players&#39; average Club Head Speed was above that. A LASSO is then fit to each of the dataframes. To facilitate comparison, coefficients are extracted from both models and then scored on the entire dataset (not split by Club Head Speed).

The slower Club Head Speed model explained a decreased 58.41% of variability in Total Strokes Gained. Exploring the coefficients of this model offers insight into the ways that players with slower swing speed succeed in competitive golf. For instance, metrics like Going for the Green - Hit Green Percentage and putting from specific distances like six feet and ten feet are of the strongest predictors for this model.

In comparison, the faster Club Head Speed model explained an increased 61.32% of variability in Total Strokes Gained. This difference in R-squared implies the difficulty of explaining the performance of golfers that swing the club slower. The magnitude of coefficients for the &quot;fast&quot; model are much greater overall suggesting that a golfer with a faster Club Head Speed is performing well based on fewer aspects of the game. Greens in Regulation Percentage as well as Fairway Proximity are quite strong predictors of Total Strokes Gained for this model. Putting statistics more negatively affect a golfers&#39; efficiency in this model compared to the &quot;slow&quot; model.

## Conclusion:

With a Club Head Speed above 115mph, professional golfers experience success because of their ability to decrease their distance to the hole on every shot on their way to the hole. They do not have to rely on making the &quot;clutch&quot; putts as much as a player with a slower swing speed. A faster Club Head Speed helps players gain enough strokes off the tee and in the fairway that making chips and ten foot putts is less important.

## Next Steps:

Collecting more data would make the model more accurate and coefficients more precise. Create some way for a competitive amateur golfer to compare themselves to PGA players with similar Club Head Speeds and discover ways that they can improve their game.
